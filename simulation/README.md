## Demo Day Simulation

Download data from (here)[https://www.ll.mit.edu/ideval/data/1999/training/week2/index.html] as required (use outside.tcpdump for each day). We use week1_monday.tcpdump, week1_tuesday.tcpdump, week1_wednesday.tcpdump, and week2_thursday.tcpdump, all put in the /ml/data directory.

To run, navigate to /ml, activate your virtualenv, and run:

```
python ../simulation/simulate.py
```
